I'm so sorry miss, but we are fully booked.
%Please come visit our restaurant at a later date.
%Oooh busy busy busy...
%If I only had one more serving bowl...
%A wine bottle? You want a wine bottle?
%I'm sorry kid but you might be a bit too young for that kind of drink.
%I mean, I might overlook it if you could find something for me.
%I need an extra serving bowl so we can serve more customers.
%If you can find one, I'd be happy to give a wine bottle to you.
%What is it? I'm really busy!
%YOU FOUND ONE!
%Thank you so much! This will help with our work.
%Although, it will create more dishes...
%Oh well, a deal's a deal. Here's a wine bottle.
%Just please don't drink it yourself...
%Thanks for the bowl again!
