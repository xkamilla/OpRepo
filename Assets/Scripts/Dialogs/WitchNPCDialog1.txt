I've been expecting you.
%I know of your situation.
%The sickness wiping down the east continent is a serious danger.
%Is that your sister
%It is only a matter of timer before she disappears from this world.
%But I cannot help you.
%Truth be told you are not the first one to come seek my aid.
%And if I fulfilled every request I get I would exhaust my powers immediately.
%But you might be able to help me, and in doing so help your sister.
%There are three artifacts. If you locate them I will be able to stop the sickness in your sister.
%It will be a temporary solution, but with the help of the artifacts I will be able to study the sickness.
%There are three portals in the room near the lobby.
%Behind each portal is the estimated location of one artfact.
%Your sister can rest here in the meanwhile. You can visit her anytime in the next room.
%I wish you the best of luck.
