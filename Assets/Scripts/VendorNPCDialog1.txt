%I've got it all! Come closer and I'm sure you'll find something!

Press 'Z'
%Maybe a gift for a wife, a colleague or a son. Take a look!

Press 'Z'
%Come see my wares!

Press 'Z'
%(Sigh... It really isn't a good selling day... And it's so hot...)

Press 'Z'
%Oh hello there!

Press 'Z'
%You want to buy a trinket? What? You don't have any money.

Press 'Z'
%Well, I had to try anyway.

Press 'Z'
%What? You want the bowl? I can't just give it to you!

Press 'Z'
%You know what. Let's make a deal.

Press 'Z'
%It's awfully hot in here. Bring me a hat of some sort and the bowl is yours.

Press 'Z'
%Is that the hat?

Press 'Z'
%I mean I guess it'll work.

Press 'Z'
%As promised, here's the bowl.

Press 'Z'
%Thanks missy!

Press 'Z'
%Finally some shade...
