Jewelry! Plates! Trinkets!
%I've got it all! Come closer and I'm sure you'll find something!
%Maybe a gift for a wife, a colleague or a son. Take a look!
%Come see my wares!
%(Sigh... It really isn't a good selling day... And it's so hot...)
%Oh hello there!
%You want to buy a trinket? What? You don't have any money.
%Well, I had to try anyway.
%What? You want the bowl? I can't just give it to you!
%You know what. Let's make a deal.
%It's awfully hot in here. Bring me a hat of some sort and the bowl is yours.
%Is that the hat?
%I mean I guess it'll work.
%As promised, here's the bowl.
%Thanks missy!
%Finally some shade...
