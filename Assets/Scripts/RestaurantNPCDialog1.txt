%If I only had one more serving bowl...

Press 'Z'
%A wine bottle? You want a wine bottle?

Press 'Z'
%I'm sorry kid but you might be a bit too young for that kind of drink.

Press 'Z'
%I mean, I might overlook it if you could find something for me.

Press 'Z'
%I need an extra serving bowl so we can serve more customers.

Press 'Z'
%If you can find one, I'd be happy to give a wine bottle to you.

Press 'Z'
%What is it? I'm really busy!

Press 'Z'
%YOU FOUND ONE!

Press 'Z'
%Thank you so much! This will help with our work.

Press 'Z'
%Although, it will create more dishes...

Press 'Z'
%Oh well, a deal's a deal. Here's a wine bottle.
